This project captures and analyzes real-time network traffic to identify unusual patterns or potential intrusions.

# Network Traffic Monitoring and Intrusion Detection

A beginner-friendly Python project for **monitoring network traffic** and **detecting suspicious activities** in real-time.  
This project helps understand basic network security concepts, traffic analysis, and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project enables you to:
- Capture live network packets.
- Analyze network traffic for IP addresses, protocols, packet size, and timestamps.
- Detect potential intrusions or anomalies like unusual port scanning or high packet frequency.
- Log data for review and alert when suspicious activity is detected.

It is an **educational tool** for learning network monitoring and IDS development.

## 🧰 Features

- 📡 Real-time packet capture using Python.
- 🔍 Traffic analysis and logging.
- ⚠️ Basic intrusion detection with alert system.
- 🗂️ Data stored for review and analysis.
- ✨ Easily extendable for custom detection rules.

🏃 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/network-traffic-monitoring-and-intrusion-detection.git
cd network-traffic-monitoring-and-intrusion-detection
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the monitoring script:


python network_monitor.py
Check console logs or logs/ folder for packet data and alerts.

🧪 Example Output
[INFO] Capturing packets...
[PACKET] Source: 192.168.1.10 → Destination: 8.8.8.8 | Protocol: UDP | Length: 58
[ALERT] Possible port scanning detected from 192.168.1.10
🔮 Future Improvements
Add Machine Learning-based anomaly detection.
Integrate with Snort / Suricata rules for more advanced IDS.
Create a web dashboard to visualize traffic.
Send email or SMS alerts for detected intrusions.

📚 Learning Outcomes
Understanding of network traffic flow.
Basics of packet analysis and logging.
Introduction to intrusion detection techniques.
Python programming applied to network security.
